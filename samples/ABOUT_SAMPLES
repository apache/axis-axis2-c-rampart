Following is a brief description of Rampart/C samples

Service : samples/services/sec_echo
---------------------------
The security enabled service. Depends on deployed security policy scenario.

Client: samples/client/sec_echo
---------------------------
The client to send secured SOAP messages. Depends on deployed security policy scenario.

Security policies: samples/secpolicy/scenarioX

Please read the README file under samples/secpolicy to learn more about them.

Callbacks : samples/callback
---------------------------
To retrieve passwords for a particular user, Rampart/C uses password callback mechanism.
Such callback modules can be plugged into Rampart/C by defining them in the policy assertions.
The sample shows how to write a simple password callback module.

Credential Provider: samples/credential_provider
------------------------------------------------
In the client side it's possible to give a username/password pair to the client, using a credential_provider.
Similar to Callbacks, these can too plugged into Rampart/C by defining them in the policy assertions.
The sample shows how to write a simple credentials provider.

Authentication Provider : samples/authn_provider
----------------------------------------------
In the server side, in order to validate a usernametoken in more application specific way, an authentication module can be used.
The authentication module gets both the username and the password and returns a status code back to Rampart/C.
The sample shows how to write a simple authentication provider.
