Getting Rampart/C source working on Linux
============================================
Build the source

This can be done using the following command sequence:
        ./configure
        make
        make install

Getting Rampart/C binary distribution working on Linux
============================================
1. Copy modules/rampart to $AXIS2C_HOME/modules
2. Copy samples/server/sec_echo to $AXIS2C_HOME/services/
3. Engage rampart as described in section "Engage Rampart/C with axis2/C"
4. Go to samples/secpolicy/ and try a scenario
    %s test_scen.sh scenarioX server-port


Engage Rampart/C with axis2/C
============================================
Prerequisites:
You must have openssl installed in you system.

Configuring:
You can angage Rampart/C in global level or in service level.
Just add following entry either to axis2.xml(gloabl level) or in services.xml(service level).
    <module ref="rampart"/>

Apart from that you must define security policies for outgoing messages and incoming messages.
This can be done adding parameters as follows in the same descriptor file that you engaged rampart. 
    <parameter name="OutflowSecurityPolicy">/your/path/to/outgoing-secpolicy.xml</parameter>
    <parameter name="InflowSecurityPolicy">/your/path/to/incoming-secpolicy.xml</parameter>
    
NOTE: There are several samples security policy xml files for different scenarios under samples/secpolicy/



Thank you for using Rampart/C
