Getting Rampart/C source working on Linux
============================================
Build the source

This can be done using the following command sequence:
        ./configure
        make
        make install

Getting Rampart/C binary distribution working on Linux
============================================
1. Copy modules/rampart to $AXIS2C_HOME/modules
2. Copy samples/server/sec_echo to $AXIS2C_HOME/services/
3. Engage rampart as described in step 3 of section "Engage Rampart/C with axis2/C"
4. Go to samples/secpolicy/ and try a scenario
    %s test_scen.sh scenarioX server-port


Engage Rampart/C with axis2/C
============================================
Prerequisites:
You must have openssl installed in you system.

Configuring:
You can angage Rampart/C in global level or in service level.
Just add following entry either to axis2.xml(gloabl level) or in services.xml(service level).
    <module ref="rampart"/>

Apart from that you must define security policies for outgoing messages and incoming messages.
This can be done adding parameters as follows
    <parameter name="OutflowSecurityPolicy">/your/path/to/outgoing-secpolicy.xml</parameter>
    <parameter name="InflowSecurityPolicy">/your/path/to/incoming-secpolicy.xml</parameter>


NOTE: See the README file in samples/client/sec_echo for more information on configuration setup.


Thank you for using Rampart/C
