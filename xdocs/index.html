  <title>The Security Module for Apache Axis2/C</title>
</head>

<body xml:lang="en">
<h1>Welcome to Apache Rampart/C</h1>

<p>Apache Rampart/C is the security module for <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/">Apache Axis2/C</a>. It features in many ways to protect SOAP messages exchanged. This includes SOAP message encryption and signature as specified in <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0.pdf">WS-Security Specification</a>. In addition Apache Rampart/C configurations are based on security policy assertions as per <a href="http://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy/ws-securitypolicy.pdf">WS-Security Policy specificatoin</a></p>

<h2>Why Apache Rampart/C ?</h2>
<p>In distributed computing, web services play a crucial role. But as many distributed systems web services are also vulnerable for security threats. Developers are always struggling to ensure the integrity, confidentiality of messages. Implementing the right security solution can be an expensive and time consuming task. Rampart/C makes the life easier for those who uses Axis2/C, by providing a configurable security module, which protect SOAP messages from such threats.
